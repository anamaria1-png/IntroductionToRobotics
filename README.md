# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects related to digital electronics and microcontroller programming,  using Arduino boards. These assignments were completed as part of a course  during the 3rd year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
  
## Homework 1
We will  install arduino IDE:https://www.arduino.cc/en/software2 and create a PRIVATE Github repository, according to these specifications: 
it is private, access to the following github users: irikos, danadascalescu00, adiRandom, alexsasu, alexion2001, surdubob, dandi08, radudilirici, vladfxstoader, IoanaLivia  and its name is name  ”IntroductionToRobotics” .
In this repo we will be posting our robotics homework, with code and videos of our work.

## Homework 2

We will use distinct potentiometers to individually manage the Red, Green, and Blue aspects of the RGB LED. This control system should utilize digital electronics, involving the Arduino to acquire potentiometer readings and subsequently assign mapped values to the corresponding LED pins.

WHAT WILL WE NEED?
 1. 1 RGB LED
 2. 3 Potentiometer
 3.Resistors and wires

## Homework 3
We design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino
platform, with 3 LEDS for the elevator floors, one LED to evidentiate the state and 1 buzzer to announce the arriving of the elevator and also doors closing and moving.If the elevator is already at the desired floor,
pressing the button for that floor should have no effect. Otherwise, after
a button press, the elevator should ”wait for the doors to close” and then
”move” to the corresponding floor. If the elevator is in movement, it
should either do nothing or it should stack its decision.

## Homework 4
We will use 1 7-segment display, 1 joystick, resistors and wires to control the position of
the segment and  they should jump from the current position
to the other positions nearby, but without passing through ”walls”. When we press the joystick, the segment we are curently on should stop blinking, and then we move to the next step.

## Homework 5
Create a stopwatch timer utilizing a 4-digit 7-segment display and three buttons. The timer should measure time in tenths of a second and include a lap-saving feature, resembling the fundamental stopwatch functions commonly found on smartphones.

## Homework 6
This is a more ample project, including: Arduino Uno Board•Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)•LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) aka Photocell aka Photoresistor aka LightSensor•RGB LED•Resistors as needed•Breadboard and connecting wires. The purpose of the project is to a menu structure , with sensor Settings,  Ultrasonic Alert Threshold and LDR Alert Threshold and then to go back to the menu.Then we need to reset the logger data, with a simple message with options of answear ''yes'' or ''no''.We have also a system Status to check current status and healthL Current Sensor Readings, Current Sensor Settings and  Display Logged Data. We also need to have a system for the RGB LED Control.
