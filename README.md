# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects related to digital electronics and microcontroller programming,  using Arduino boards. These assignments were completed as part of a course  during the 3rd year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
  
## Homework 1
We will  install arduino IDE:https://www.arduino.cc/en/software2 and create a PRIVATE Github repository, according to these specifications: 
it is private, access to the following github users: irikos, danadas-calescu00, adiRandom, alexsasu, alexion2001, surdubob, dandi08, radudilirici, vladfxstoader, IoanaLivia  and its name is name  ”IntroductionToRobotics” .
In this repo we will be posting our robotics homework, with code and videos of or work.

## Homework 2
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,
Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically,
you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a
mapped value to the LED pins.


## Homework 3
We design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino
platform, with 3 LEDS for the elevator floors, one LED to evidentiate the state and 1 buzzer to announce the arriving of the elevator and also doors closing and moving.If the elevator is already at the desired floor,
pressing the button for that floor should have no effect. Otherwise, after
a button press, the elevator should ”wait for the doors to close” and then
”move” to the corresponding floor. If the elevator is in movement, it
should either do nothing or it should stack its decision.
