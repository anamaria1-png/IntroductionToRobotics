# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

_Description about the repo.
Examples include, but are not limited to: "Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files."_ (write your own version)
  
## Homework 1
Deadline (hard): 20th of October, 23:59.The first homework is easy, so I advise doing it right for maximum points.
1.  Install arduino IDE:https://www.arduino.cc/en/software2.
2.  Create a PRIVATE Github repository, according to these specifications:  
    •Use this as an example:https://github.com/Irikos/IntroductionToRobotics  
    •Repository must be private  
    •You must provide access to the following github users: irikos, danadas-calescu00, adiRandom, alexsasu, alexion2001, surdubob, dandi08, radudilirici, vladfxstoader, IoanaLivia  
    •Repository  must  be  name  ”IntroductionToRobotics”  (or  some-thing very similar, but with a good reason)
    •Must include similar Readme.md with title and an initial description  
    •You are free (and encouraged) to be creative with your repository de-scription.However, the freedom of creativity must not be confused with and excuse to be lazy.  The requirements specified here and in the repository description are considered basic and must be met.  
    •When done, you must turn in the homework on teams,with the linkto it in the message.  We will check it once turned in (we’ll get100+ prompts for accept, so don’t expect toknowthat you turnedit without doing so)  
    •The  entire  idea  is  to  design  the  repository  such  that  it  would  bebest understood by someone  who does  not know  your  work,  like  arecruiter.   The  repository  is  not  a  full  tutorial  on  how  to  do  thehomework, but an insight into your work and how you did them  
    •Each  homework  (excluding  the  projects,  though)  will  be  uploadedhere each week  
    •Keep  in  mind  that  repository  design  will  be  graded. File  naming,arrangements (asset folder etc) are important
